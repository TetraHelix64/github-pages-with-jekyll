Great job! Now that GitHub Pages is enabled, you can view your website here: https://tetrahelix64.github.io/github-pages-with-jekyll/

You can customize your homepage by adding content to either an index file or the README.md file. GitHub Pages first looks for an index file. If an index file is found, GitHub Pages uses the content in the file to create the homepage. If an index file isn’t found, it uses the README.md to create the homepage.

Your repository has an index.md file so we can update it to include your personalized content.

###⌨️ Activity: Create your homepage
1. Navigate to the Code tab of this repository, and browse to the index.md file, or click this link here
2. In the upper right corner, click the the icon to the right of the file to edit the index.md file
3. Type the content you want on your homepage
4. Scroll to the bottom, type a commit message, and click Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request
5. Open a pull request<br/>`<br/><!--added a break here.-->`
Once you have created your pull request, I will move over there to discuss next steps.
